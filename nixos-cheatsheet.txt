I write what I learn here about nix os

nixos config file location:
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

rebuilding what I change inside nixos config:
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
with this I can switch with next boot: (usefull for system upgrades)
sudo nixos-rebuild boot

clean other generations in nixos:
sudo nix-collect-grabage
and then a rebuild switch
adding -d option will keep my current version and delete all others
--delete-older-than nd (means number of days) will delete generation older that that number

an system update script is a good idea:
sudo nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d or 7d (low storage)
sudo nixos-rebuild boot --upgrade
(any other thing I may need to upgrade)

rollback to previous generation:
nixos-rebuild switch --rollback

show nixos options:
nixos-option <option>
